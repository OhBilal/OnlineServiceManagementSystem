 Online Service Management System

Online Service Management System is a project which aims in developing a Online Application to maintain all the daily work of Service Centre. This project has many features which are generally not available in normal Online Service Management Systems like Product/Parts Records, Issue Customer Bill etc. It also has a facility of admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system. This System can be used to search for Assign Work, Add/Remove Technician, Add/Remove Products etc. The admin after logging into his account can generate various reports such as Product Sell Report and Service/Work Report. Overall, this project of ours is being developed to help the Service Centre to maintain the Service Centre in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
